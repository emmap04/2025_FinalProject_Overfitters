üíî Predicting Divorce Probability Using Machine Learning

üìå Abstract
This project explores machine learning methods to predict divorce probability using a dataset containing a range of personal, social, and psychological variables within marriages. We aim to evaluate and compare the performance of three models:

A model using only the three most highly correlated features

A model excluding the three least correlated features

A model using all available features

Each model will be trained and tested using standard machine learning workflows. Evaluation metrics include Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification reports. We hypothesize that the model using all features will yield the most accurate predictions.

üìä Dataset Description
Dataset Title: Marriage and Divorce Dataset
Source: Kaggle Dataset
Columns: 31 total (30 features + 1 target)
Target Variable: Divorce Probability

Key Feature Categories:

Demographic: Age Gap, Education

Psychological: Mental Health, Self-Confidence

Compatibility: Cultural Similarities, Common Interests, Religion Compatibility

Socioeconomic: Economic Similarity, Good Income

Relational: Love, Commitment, Communication

Background: Previous Marriage, Addiction, Family History of Divorce

‚ùì Research Question
Main Question:
Which machine learning model yields the most accurate prediction of divorce probability?

Hypothesis:
The model trained using all features will outperform the others in predictive accuracy.

‚öôÔ∏è Analytical Approach
Our approach includes:

Feature analysis to identify the most and least correlated features

Model training on three different feature sets:

Top 3 correlated features only

All features except 3 least correlated

All features included

Evaluation using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared (R¬≤)

Accuracy

Confusion matrix

Classification report

Visualizations including:

Pairplots for highest/lowest correlated feature models

Scatter plots with regression lines
