# üíî Predicting Divorce Probability Using Machine Learning  

## üìå Abstract

This project explores machine learning methods to predict divorce probability using a dataset containing a range of personal, social, and psychological variables within marriages. We aim to evaluate and compare the performance of three models:

1. A model using only the three most highly correlated features  
2. A model excluding the three least correlated features  
3. A model using all available features  

Each model will be trained and tested using standard machine learning workflows. Evaluation metrics include Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification reports. We hypothesize that the model using all features will yield the most accurate predictions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Analytical Approach

Our approach includes:

- Feature analysis to identify the most and least correlated features  
- Model training on three different feature sets:
  - Top 3 correlated features only
  - All features except 3 least correlated
  - All features included  
- Evaluation using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared (R¬≤)
  - Accuracy
- Visualizations including:
  - Pairplots for highest/lowest correlated feature models
  - Scatter plots with regression lines
